# Technical-Projects
* Vibrational Analysis of Wing. Wing designed using SolidWorks and Ansys Design Modeller, simulation done using Ansys Modal
* 2D FEM code for plane stress plane strain condition. Implemented using Matlab. Main_FEM_2D is the main code, MasterSQBLElement is the physical to master transformation function, Meshing_SqBilinear is the Meshing function.
* Topo_2D is the 2D topology optimisation code implemented using Matlab
