# Technical-Projects
* Vibrational Analysis of Wing: The wing was designed using SolidWorks and Ansys Design Modeller, and simulation was done using Ansys Modal for different rib spacings.
* 2D FEM code for plane stress plane strain condition: Implemented using Matlab. Main_FEM_2D is the main code, MasterSQBLElement is the physical to master transformation function for Square bilinear elements, and Meshing_SqBilinear is the Meshing function for square bilinear elements.
* Topo_2D: 2D topology optimization code implemented using Matlab.
* 3D FEM code: Implemented using Matlab. Main_FEM_3D is the main code, MasterElement is the physical to master transformation function for hexahedral brick elements, and Meshing_1oHex is the meshing function for 1st-order hexahedral elements.
* Topo_3D: 3D topology optimization code implemented using Matlab.
